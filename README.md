# Python
This repository records my Python coding experience. 

**Ann's Projects** folder contains my original codes for various purposes, including the homework and projects for Python Bootcamp at Udemy that I've taken, my further data analytics ideas for business, and so on. 

**Notes from Tutorials** folder contains some else's codes from various online tutorials that helped me learn Python as a whole, for which I don't take any credits.
